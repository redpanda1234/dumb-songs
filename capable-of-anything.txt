What is this?
It doesn’t make much sense
They teach it like it's Python
``Now just prove this inductively''
And I’m sure they meant
I could recursion it
The difference escapes me

Cause I stopped understanding anything
I gave up
We're told we are capable of anything
But I don’t seem to think that I can
Prove this problem's NP

Swung and missed
I put my heart in this
I said ``it can't be greedy''
(Though I wanted it to be)
But that was bad and wrong
And when I saw Prof. Ran
I had no rubles left and so
My grutors have to dock some points

But I stopped caring about what they think about me
I now know
When we're told we are ``capable of anything''
That really means that they believe
That mistakes are integral to learning

We are capable of anything
But you don’t seem to think that
You can prove big O's and not just cry
That you could ever write a sort or even try
That you could solve the TSP without a lie
But you might
