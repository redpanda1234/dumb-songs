// Sung to the tune of _The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelinâ€™ Groovy)_,

// Dedicated to Dagan Karp and his awesome Rep. Theory class

Slow down, you prove too fast
You got to make your theorems last
You're flying down the blackboard rows
Drawing Young Tableaux in Rep. Theory
Ba da-da da-da da-da, Rep. Theory

Hello module, what'cha knowin'
I've come to watch your actions flowin'
Ain't you got no chi's for me?
Doo-ait-n-doo-doo, feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy

There're no reps induced, or restricted for for me
I'm lost and confused so I think I'll just sleep
Let Feiyang and Princewill drop their fury on me      // These were
                                                      // the graders
Yet I still love Karp, he's so groovy
