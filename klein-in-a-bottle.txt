// Sung to the tune of _Time in a Bottle_, by Jim Croce

If I could save Klein in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to glue
Is an edge to an edge
Of a projective plane and then #
With another Pâ‚‚

If I could make my space connected
If words could make compactness true
I'd recite every proof in a point set topology book
Then homology too

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the chase you wanna use once you find it

I've looked around enough to know
That there's no way to possibly metrize this

If I had a Box just for wishes
And claims that had never come true
The Box would be empty except for a memory of how
It's disliked by prof. Su

Because it never seems to be a good way
To figure out what ``open'' means in products

I've looked around enough to know
That infinite spaces always break this object
